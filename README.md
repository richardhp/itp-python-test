# ITP python test - Richard Howell-Peak

I ended up extracting the Lead and Contact class into a separate file
so that I could import it both into the main file and also the tests.

I did not copy the entire body of test data into the tests, I just tried
some examples to make sure that the functionality was correct.

I felt like some of the code was a bit repetitive and could have potentially
been abstracted further but I felt this was going to get in the way of readability
and maintainability, so I left it at a level I felt that the code communicated
the intent of the requirements well.
